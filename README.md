# code script introduction
the script is coded as follows' stepsï¼š
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

* the "activity label" is in the file of "activity_label.txt" and linked the y_*.txt file.
* we can find the mean and std columns based on the "feature.txt".

there are details in the code, thanks.
